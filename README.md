👋 Hi there! I'm a junior full-stack web developer with a passion for problem-solving and a strong foundation in web development. My journey began as a freelancer, specializing in building static websites using Webflow, mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for exceptional design and frontend experiences.

🌐 As I delved deeper into the tech world, I explored programming languages like Python and Java. I've honed my skills by tackling over 100 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) challenges, covering topics such as Binary Search, Recursion, Stacks, Arrays, Strings, and even Maze Navigation.

🚀 Currently, I'm developing full-stack applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), seamlessly combining my frontend and backend expertise to create dynamic web applications.

🌟 I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to innovative solutions. Let's connect and explore opportunities to work together on exciting projects!
